# A Simple Binder Example

This repository contains a small collection of Jupyter notebooks and data, and can be used as an example of how to set up a fully interactive version of your repository using Binder.

## Binder Quickstart

You can find more detailed instructions on the [Binder documentation site](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You'll need:
- A public git repository that contains one or more Jupyter notebooks (or similar files).
- A `requirements.txt` or `environment.yaml` file that lists all packages required by your project.

Then go to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), provide the link to your repo and try it out!
